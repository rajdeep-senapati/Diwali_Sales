## 📁 Project Structure

- `Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, cleaning, EDA, and visualizations
- `Diwali Sales Data.csv`: Raw dataset used for analysis (assumed to be present)
- Visuals embedded within the notebook for easier interpretation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – for data loading and manipulation
  - `numpy` – for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` – for data visualization

---

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed null or missing values
- Converted appropriate columns to correct data types (e.g., age to categorical)
- Filtered out irrelevant or duplicate records

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extracted new insights such as:
  - `Total Amount Spent` per customer
  - `Age Group` and `Gender` distribution
- Removed unused columns such as `Status`, `unnamed`, etc.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate Analysis**:
  - Distribution of customers by gender, age, city, marital status, and product categories
- **Bivariate Analysis**:
  - Total spending by age group and gender
  - Relationship between marital status and spending
  - Top performing states and product categories

### 4. Visualizations
- Bar plots and pie charts used to show:
  - Top 10 states and cities by sales
  - Popular product categories
  - Spending behavior by demographic groups

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Married women aged 26–35** in **Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities** are the highest spenders during Diwali.
- **Electronics and clothing** are the most purchased categories.
- Businesses can increase revenue by targeting specific customer segments via region-specific marketing.
